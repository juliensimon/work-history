## Abstract

Traditional operating systems have been designed as monolithic kernels implementing the whole set of system services, leading to important maintenance and evolution problems. This paper discusses a new design methodology where the operating system is implemented as a set of servers using the services provided by a microkernel.

The Masix system is made up of three layers:
1. **Host system**: Provides services for dynamic inclusion of new servers and different user interfaces
2. **Unix environment**: Contains servers providing Unix abstractions and semantics based on optimized implementations using Mach microkernel facilities
3. **Virtual system**: Made up of servers providing distributed features, dynamically included using host system services

The resulting structure is innovative and easy to extend, serving as the basis for future distributed operating system research.

**Keywords:** Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, Organization and Design, Microkernel, Multi-server architecture

## System Architecture

### Design Principles

#### Multi-Server Approach
- **Modularity**: Each server written and tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused server components
- **Dynamic Extension**: Easy addition of new servers to running system
- **Protection**: Each server in separate address space

#### Microkernel Foundation
- **Mach microkernel**: Provides tasks, message communication, devices, and memory management
- **User-mode implementation**: System services implemented in user space
- **Minimal kernel**: Kernel provides only essential resource management

### Three-Layer Architecture

#### Host System
- **Dynamic service management**: Allows inclusion of new servers
- **Multiple user interfaces**: Support for different environments
- **Generic services**: Common functionality for all environments
- **Server coordination**: Management of inter-server communication

#### Unix Environment
- **Unix compatibility**: Full Unix interface and semantics
- **Optimized implementations**: New implementations using Mach facilities
- **Server-based design**: Unix services split across multiple servers
- **Binary compatibility**: Support for existing Unix applications

#### Virtual System
- **Distributed features**: Network resource optimization
- **Dynamic inclusion**: Servers added as needed
- **Transparent distribution**: Hide network complexity from applications
- **Resource sharing**: Optimal use of networked stations

## Technical Implementation

### Naming and Protection

#### Object-Based Design
- **Typed objects**: Each server manages specific object types
- **Fixed dialog protocols**: Standardized communication patterns
- **Port-based identification**: Mach ports used as object identifiers
- **Server responsibility**: Each server manages its own object types

#### Protection Mechanisms
- **Send rights**: Access control through Mach port rights
- **Server authorization**: Servers control access to their objects
- **Port-based security**: No send right means no access
- **Type safety**: Objects have well-defined interfaces

### Server Structure

#### Multi-Threaded Design
- **Multiple threads**: Each server contains several threads
- **Port sets**: All object ports contained in single port set
- **Dynamic distribution**: Requests distributed among threads
- **Synchronization**: Thread coordination for shared data access

#### Communication Model
- **Remote procedure calls**: System calls implemented as RPCs
- **Message-based**: All communication through Mach messages
- **Request-reply**: Client sends request, waits for reply
- **Port-based routing**: Messages routed to appropriate servers

## System Categories

### Traditional Monolithic Systems
- **OSF/1 IK**: Uses Mach as basis for low-level layers
- **Characteristics**: Traditional kernel structure with Mach foundation

### Single-Server Systems
- **OSF/1 MK**: Unix semantics in single task
- **CMU Unix Server**: Alternative single-server approach
- **Characteristics**: Simpler but less modular

### Multi-Server Systems
- **CMU Unix Multi Server**: Several cooperating tasks
- **Masix**: Novel multi-server approach with three-layer design
- **Characteristics**: Maximum modularity and extensibility

## Performance Optimizations

### Context Switch Reduction
- **Minimal server involvement**: Reduce number of servers per system call
- **Optimized message passing**: Efficient inter-server communication
- **Caching strategies**: Reduce repeated server interactions
- **Batch operations**: Group related operations

### Communication Efficiency
- **Message optimization**: Minimize message size and frequency
- **Port set usage**: Efficient handling of multiple communication channels
- **Thread scheduling**: Optimize thread allocation for communication patterns
- **Memory management**: Efficient buffer handling for messages

## Distributed Features

### Network Integration
- **Transparent distribution**: Hide network topology from applications
- **Resource optimization**: Optimal use of networked resources
- **Load distribution**: Balance load across network nodes
- **Fault tolerance**: Handle network failures gracefully

### Dynamic Extension
- **Runtime server addition**: Add new servers without system restart
- **Environment switching**: Support multiple operating system personalities
- **Protocol adaptation**: Support different network protocols
- **Service discovery**: Dynamic finding of available services

## Advantages and Trade-offs

### Advantages
- **Modularity**: Independent server development and testing
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new features
- **Protection**: Strong isolation between components
- **Evolution**: System can evolve without major redesign

### Challenges
- **Performance overhead**: Context switches and message exchanges
- **Complexity**: More complex than monolithic systems
- **Shared data**: Difficult to implement shared data structures
- **Coordination**: Complex inter-server communication patterns
