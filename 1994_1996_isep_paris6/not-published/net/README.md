## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis of communication systems based on the Mach microkernel. The research is conducted in the context of the Masix distributed operating system project, which aims to provide communication services that satisfy the needs of all system components including system servers, environment servers, and applications running above these environments.

The paper identifies four fundamental requirements for the Masix network server:

1. **Inter-process communication transparency**: Remote communications must follow the same semantics as local communications, with no assumptions about entity location
2. **Maximum performance**: Achieve or exceed monolithic system performance through various optimization techniques
3. **Multi-protocol support**: Dynamic management of communication protocols specific to each environment
4. **Communication security**: Guarantee data confidentiality through entity authentication and data encryption

The analysis covers both kernel-mode and user-mode communication mechanisms in Mach, examining their strengths, limitations, and applicability to distributed systems.

**Keywords:** Mach microkernel, inter-process communication, distributed systems, network protocols, performance optimization, security
