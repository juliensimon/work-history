Masix is based on the Mach 3.0 microkernel. As such, Mach does not provide
all the traditional functionalities usually found in an operating system.
It only provides~:
\begin{itemize}
\item task and thread management, which is the implementation basis for 
processes. A task is a resource allocation unit, whereas a thread is an
execution unit~;
\item local interprocess communication (IPC), according to a client-server model
 based on ports and messages. A port is an unidirectional communication channel,
protected by send and receive rights. A message is a set of typed data, sent to a port~;
\item physical and virtual memory management~;
\item physical peripherals management.
\end{itemize}
