Masix is built according to the multi-server model, which grants it a high
modularity. Indeed, each server can be written and tested independently from
the others. Also, it is possible to add or remove dynamically a server to
the system.

Masix is made up of two layers, shown on Figure~\ref{fig:masix2-us}. The upper
one is the personalities, which implement the semantics of traditional
operating systems. The lower one is
the Distributed Generic Layer (DGL), which offers generic
services to the multiple personalities (communication, shared memory,
process management, fault tolerance,~\dots).
