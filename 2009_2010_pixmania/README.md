This directory contains artifacts from **Julien Simon's** time as **CTO at Pixmania**, one of Europe's fastest-growing online retailers, where he led the transformation from reactive firefighting to proactive engineering and professionalized processes.

## üè¢ Company Overview

When I joined Pixmania in May 2009 as Chief Technology Officer, I found myself entrusted with the technology foundation of one of Europe's fastest‚Äëgrowing online retailers‚Äîa business already processing over ‚Ç¨2 billion in gross merchant value each year through more than 600 Linux servers spread across seven data centers. From the outset, my mandate was to move Pixmania from reactive firefighting to proactive engineering, professionalize our processes, and prepare our platform to serve not only Pixmania's direct customers but also our sister banners under DSG International‚ÄîCurrys, PC World and Dixons‚Äîthrough a new white‚Äëlabel SaaS offering.

My first priority was to introduce rigor and cadence to our software delivery.  Drawing on the rich guidance from the Scrum community, I partnered with seasoned agile coaches to roll out Scrum across 15 cross‚Äëfunctional teams encompassing 150 engineers‚Äîfront‚Äëoffice PHP and PL/SQL developers, QA analysts, business‚Äëintelligence specialists, and operations staff.  Within six months, our sprint‚Äëbased planning and continuous‚Äëintegration pipelines had doubled our release frequency, materially reducing the number of emergency patches in production and instilling a culture of shared ownership and iterative improvement.

While our development velocity surged, I recognized that our infrastructure needed equal attention.  To guarantee uninterrupted service for Pixmania‚Äôs 35‚ÄØmillion monthly visitors‚Äîand to support the portfolios of Currys and PC¬†World‚ÄîI led the design and deployment of an active‚Äëactive Oracle RAC cluster across our two primary sites at Equinix Paris and Interxion Nanterre.  By leveraging Oracle‚Äôs shared‚Äëstorage Real Application Cluster architecture, we achieved true zero‚Äëdowntime failover with sub‚Äësecond switchovers, ensuring that maintenance windows never impacted customer experiences.  We tied the cluster together with a private dark‚Äëfiber/MPLS backbone, so data replications and transaction commits remained seamless no matter which node processed the request.

Storage scale and performance were equally critical.  We partnered with NetApp, a world leader in data storage and cloud data management, to house over one petabyte of photo content for mypix.com on high‚Äëperformance filer arrays.  NetApp's mature snapshot and replication technologies allowed us to protect critical assets without slowing our web tier.  This architecture supported our photo storage platform while Oracle underpinned Pixmania's catalog‚Äîwhich had grown to more than 1.4 million SKUs across consumer electronics, telecommunications and home appliances‚Äîand the bespoke storefronts we launched for Currys, PC World and Dixons under our new white‚Äëlabel SaaS platform.

Managing costs while scaling at this pace was a constant challenge.  With ownership of a ‚Ç¨6‚ÄØmillion annual IT budget, I instituted strict cost‚Äëoptimization measures and transparent supplier‚Äëmanagement practices.  Through careful contract renegotiations, vendor consolidation, and utilization audits, we drove a 20‚ÄØpercent reduction in operating expenses within twelve months, all without compromising SLAs or system capacity.

Quality, compliance and support standards were the last piece of the puzzle.  Recognizing the importance of predictable service for our B2B partners, I led the implementation of ISO‚ÄØ9001 and ITIL frameworks within our technical‚Äësupport organization.  We formalized incident‚Äëmanagement processes, introduced key performance metrics, and aligned escalation paths‚Äîimprovements that drove a 35‚ÄØpercent reduction in ticket‚Äëto‚Äëresolution time and delivered consistently higher satisfaction scores from our reseller network.
