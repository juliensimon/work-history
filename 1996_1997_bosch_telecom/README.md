**At Bosch Telecom in Louveciennes, France (1996â€“1997), I worked as a Systems Software Engineer on the Integral7 PBXâ€”an embedded enterprise telecom platform deployed across Europe. I was responsible for the full design, development, and validation of a real-time C++ communication library that bridged legacy PBX internals with a modern SNMP-based management interface.**

The Integral7 system combined Motorola 68k-based legacy boardsâ€”running Pascal applications for core switchingâ€”with a PowerPC board running **ChorusOS 3.2**, a real-time microkernel operating system. The communication library I built allowed SNMP agents running on the ChorusOS board to interact seamlessly with the Pascal-based switching logic, without exposing the complexity of the underlying proprietary backplane or legacy codebase.

The project required deep integration work. I abstracted a proprietary inter-board communication protocol into a clean C++ API that provided structured access to PBX metrics such as call activity, port status, alarms, and system alerts. The interface supported both polling and event-driven modes, enabling compatibility with standard SNMP query and trap mechanisms.

My library was fully multithreaded and designed to operate reliably under the deterministic constraints of an RTOS. I used ChorusOS-native threading and synchronization primitives to coordinate data access between polling threads, trap-generation threads, and SNMP service layers. Because the SNMP agent ran locally on the embedded board, the library enabled low-latency access to live PBX data without network round trips or system load penalties.

Development was done on a Solaris workstation, with cross-compilation and deployment to the PowerPC-based ChorusOS board. I completed the entire lifecycle: system design, implementation, test automation, integration, documentation, and final user acceptance testing (UAT).

I also collaborated remotely with a team of around 20 application developers in Bangalore and Frankfurt, providing architectural guidance, integration support, and troubleshooting assistance throughout the development cycle.

This project placed me squarely at the intersection of telecom infrastructure, embedded systems, and network management. It was a deeply technical and rewarding role that strengthened my skills in low-level systems programming, real-time design, and cross-domain software integration.
