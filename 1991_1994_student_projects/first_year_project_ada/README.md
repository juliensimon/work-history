This directory contains **Julien Simon's** first-year engineering project - a comprehensive Monopoly board game simulation implemented in Ada.

## üìö Project Overview

This Ada implementation demonstrates software engineering principles through a complete Monopoly board game simulation. The project incorporates financial modeling, probability analysis, and strategic decision-making algorithms.

## üéØ Project Description

A complete Monopoly board game simulation that demonstrates object-oriented design principles in Ada. The project includes a full game board with properties, player management, financial transactions, and game state tracking. Players can buy properties, collect rent, trade with each other, and experience all the classic Monopoly game mechanics in a computerized environment.

The system implements a comprehensive economic simulation where players can buy properties, collect rent, engage in trading negotiations, and experience realistic market dynamics. The codebase features risk assessment algorithms that calculate probability distributions for dice rolls and their financial impact on player fortunes. The project includes statistical modeling for property valuation, market analysis, and strategic planning tools that help players make informed investment decisions.
