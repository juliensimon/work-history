This directory contains **Julien Simon's** second-year engineering project - a pure object-oriented programming system implemented in Smalltalk.

## üìö Project Overview

This project demonstrates mastery of Smalltalk programming language and pure object-oriented design principles. Smalltalk represents one of the purest implementations of OOP concepts, where "everything is an object."

## üéØ Project Description

A pure object-oriented programming project that explores Smalltalk's elegant design philosophy. The project implements fundamental data structures and algorithms using Smalltalk's message-passing paradigm, demonstrating how everything in the system is treated as an object. This includes basic types like numbers and strings, as well as complex data structures, all communicating through message passing.

The system implements a comprehensive Question-Answer-Multiple-Choice (QCM) framework where students, professors, and courses are all represented as objects communicating through message passing. The architecture features dynamic object creation, reflection capabilities, and interactive development techniques that showcase Smalltalk's unique programming paradigm.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

### Smalltalk Programming Concepts
- **Objects and Messages** - Pure object-oriented communication
- **Class Hierarchy** - Inheritance and polymorphism
- **Dynamic Binding** - Runtime method resolution
- **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory management
- **Reflection** - Self-modifying code capabilities

### Pure Object-Oriented Principles
- **Everything is an Object** - Numbers, strings, classes are all objects
- **Message Passing** - Objects communicate through messages
- **Encapsulation** - Data and behavior bundled together
- **Inheritance** - Code reuse through class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism** - Different objects respond to same messages

### Educational Features
- **Interactive Environment** - Live programming and debugging
- **Visual Programming** - GUI-based development environment
- **Incremental Development** - Modify code while running
- **Testing Framework** - Built-in testing capabilities

## üìä Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- **Pure OOP Understanding**: Grasp of object-oriented fundamentals
- **Smalltalk Mastery**: Proficiency in Smalltalk programming
- **Design Thinking**: Object-oriented problem solving
- **Interactive Development**: Live programming techniques
- **Language Philosophy**: Understanding of programming language design

## üéì Educational Context

### Second Year Engineering Focus
- **Pure Object-Oriented Programming**: Learning OOP from its purest form
- **Language Diversity**: Experience with different OOP implementations
- **Interactive Development**: Live programming and debugging
- **Philosophical Understanding**: Programming language design principles

### Smalltalk Language Benefits

## üìà Comparative Learning

### Language Comparison
- **Ada**: Structured programming with strong typing
- **C++**: Hybrid OOP with performance focus
- **Smalltalk**: Pure OOP with dynamic typing

### Programming Paradigm Evolution
- **Procedural ‚Üí Object-Oriented**: Transition in programming thinking
- **Static ‚Üí Dynamic**: Different approaches to type systems
- **Compiled ‚Üí Interpreted**: Different execution models
- **Batch ‚Üí Interactive**: Different development approaches

## üß† Conceptual Understanding

### Object-Oriented Thinking
- **Object-Centric Design**: Thinking in terms of objects and relationships
- **Message-Oriented Communication**: Objects communicate through messages
- **Behavioral Design**: Focus on what objects can do rather than what they are
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favoring object composition

### Programming Philosophy
- **Simplicity**: Elegant solutions to complex problems
- **Expressiveness**: Clear and readable code
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable and extensible systems
- **Interactivity**: Immediate feedback and experimentation
