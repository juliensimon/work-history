This directory contains **Julien Simon's** second-year engineering project - an object-oriented programming system implemented in C++.

## üìö Project Overview

This project demonstrates understanding of C++ programming language and object-oriented design principles. The system explores inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and other OOP concepts through practical implementation.

## üéØ Project Description

A comprehensive object-oriented programming project that implements a restaurant simulation system. The project demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including class hierarchies, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management. The simulation models a restaurant with multiple servers, customer queues, and event-driven architecture, showcasing real-world application of OOP principles.

The simulation engine uses discrete event simulation techniques to accurately model customer arrival patterns, service times, and queue management. The object-oriented design features a comprehensive class hierarchy including customers, servers, queues, and time management systems. The project implements advanced C++ features such as virtual functions for polymorphic behavior, dynamic memory management, and template-based generic programming.
