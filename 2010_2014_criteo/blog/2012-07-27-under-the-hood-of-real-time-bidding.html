<span style="background-color: white; color: #334455; font-family: inherit;">Within the display advertising environment, Real-Time Bidding has evolved from curiosity to mainstay in the last 18 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though real-time bidding can appear to be a pretty simple value proposition – advertisers bid, win and display on an impression-by-impression basis –don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s unsophisticated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology behind RTB is extraordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Criteo, we’ve built out our real-time capabilities from scratch in the last two years, to handle 7 billion daily RTB requests on 16 exchanges covering more than 30 countries.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Big challenge, big solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s take a look under the hood, shall we?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em></em></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #334455; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to participate on a RTB exchange, media buyers first need to implement proper bidding protocols.&nbsp;Apart from the nascent&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/openrtb/" style="-webkit-transition: all 0.2s linear; border-bottom-color: rgb(208, 220, 223); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px; color: #556677; outline: 0px !important; text-decoration: none;">OpenRTB initiative</a>, there is not yet an industry-wide standard, so development work is required in each case.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting everything set is usually quite straightforward, especially with the right software architecture (and the right team … another story in itself).&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the ecosystem is made up of many companies figuring this out on the fly – no names – things can occasionally get tricky and surprises can happen.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #334455; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Now, what about the bidding process?&nbsp;&nbsp;In a trivial case, where an advertiser might simply enter a bid ten cents across the board, the process is not a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the non-trivial case, a bid should be the end result of the system applying sophisticated algorithms to a combination of data sent in the request as well as the media buyer’s own data.&nbsp;&nbsp;This data can include things like:</span></div>
<ul style="color: #334455; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 3em;">
<li style="list-style: disc; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">User properties: user id (cookie matching required), user data stored by your platform</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="color: #334455; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 3em;">
<li style="list-style: disc; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Zone properties: size, positioning e.g. above or below the fold</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="color: #334455; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 3em;">
<li style="list-style: disc; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Website properties: domain, URL, site content.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="color: #334455; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 3em;">
<li style="list-style: disc; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Business rules: block lists, ad verification for brand safety.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; color: #334455; font-family: inherit;">For the winning bidder, it’s then time to deliver a banner, which could again range from a simple, static banner to a unique, fully personalized ad incorporating multiple products, offers, layouts, etc.&nbsp;</span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #334455; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Up to now, all of this is actually the easy part!&nbsp;&nbsp;And here’s the real catch: once a request has been sent by the exchange, the bid must be received within a very short amount of time - generally under 100 milliseconds.&nbsp;Since typical one-way coast-to-coast latency in the US being 75 milliseconds, infrastructure becomes the alpha and omega of RTB. Get it wrong and your most clever algorithm won’t even get a chance to bid!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #334455; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">The next challenge is then to introduce as much algorithmic intelligence as possible in whatever precious time is left. This leads to another problem: namely, storing and retrieving data quickly enough within the bidding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are the issues of logging and crunching huge amounts of data, and detecting and fixing technical issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the unannounced specification changes breaking the protocol, but I said “no names.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and did I mention 24/7/365 availability?&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on and on.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #334455; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">RTB is far from mundane, and it represents a tremendous technical challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s also the future of media buying, and so we keep working at it.</span></div>
