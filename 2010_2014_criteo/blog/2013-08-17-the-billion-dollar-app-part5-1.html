<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a> once said (before many of you were even born): "<i>You know you have a distributed system when the crash of a computer you've never heard of stops you from getting any work done</i>". The Internet sure proved him right, as demonstrated again last night by Google and their global worldwide crash...<br />
<br />
However, when distributed systems work as intended, interesting things do happen. For instance, if one was so inclined, one could reimplement a server in a different language while preserving interfaces and things-would-still-work.<br />
<br />
And so, as I sipped my morning coffee, I became very much fucking inclined indeed to rewrite <a href="http://juliensimon.blogspot.fr/2013/08/nodejs-part-5-zero-hero.html">yesterday's Node.js <i>zeromq</i> server</a>&nbsp;in C. Call it my stupid idea of the day... or just an interesting comparison of two pieces of code standing 40 years apart :) In the real world, one good reason to do this would be to improve performance of critical parts of your application: divide, rewrite, conquer!<br />
<br />
Here's the ANSI89-compliant code (also on <a href="https://github.com/juliensimon/NodeApp/blob/master/v5-server.c">Github</a>), the only deviance being the use of <i>snprintf</i>() which only made it into C99 :)<br />

Nice. In all fairness, <a href="http://juliensimon.blogspot.fr/2013/08/nodejs-part-5-zero-hero.html">yesterday's Node.js code</a> is quite easier to read. I did add more error management clutter in the C program, but doing without it is not an option. Love them or hate them, modern languages will spit a stack trace out when they crash: most of the time, this is enough to start investigating. On the other hand, &nbsp;C will say : "<i>core dumped</i>" and leave you crying all the way home: so yes, you HAVE to write more C code to get roughly the same level of information. You can also see the immense power of&nbsp;<i>toString</i>() and dynamic typing, although the latter does introduces huge caveats.<br />
<br />
So, what did we learn? Breaking down your app not only allows you to scale it piece by piece: it also gives you the freedom to rewrite critical parts, whatever your motivation is. To me, this is true modularity, something that I've rarely seen in so-called modular architectures based on Java or C#. Having classes is nice, but <u>services</u> are what you really need.<br />
<br />
And yeah, for ultimate control and performance, C cannot be defeated. I'm quite scared to see it disappear from many curriculums. Kids, listen to the old man: you must learn C. You'll thank me later.<br />
<br />
End of sermon. Now go in peace and hack at the world!
