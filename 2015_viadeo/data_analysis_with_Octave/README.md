This directory contains **Julien Simon's** data analysis work at Viadeo using Octave/Matlab for statistical analysis and business intelligence.

## üìö Project Overview

This collection of Octave scripts demonstrates data analysis techniques applied to business problems, focusing on user behavior analysis, statistical modeling, and automated reporting for Viadeo's professional networking platform.

## üéØ Project Description

A comprehensive data analysis project that examines user behavior patterns on Viadeo's professional networking platform. The project includes statistical analysis of user engagement, retention modeling, and business intelligence reporting. The analysis covers both short-term (30-day) and long-term (90-day) user activity patterns, providing insights into platform performance and user satisfaction.

The analytics platform features user segmentation algorithms, retention modeling, and predictive analytics for user engagement patterns. The system implements time-series analysis for both short-term (30-day) and long-term (90-day) user activity tracking, providing insights into platform usage patterns and user satisfaction metrics.
