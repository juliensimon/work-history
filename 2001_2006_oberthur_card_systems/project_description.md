In 2002, I joined **Oberthur Card Systems** in Paris as a **Manager of SIM Applications Development**. I started smallâ€”leading a focused team of eight engineers. We worked closely with major mobile operators across Europe, building highly customized SIM applications. It was hands-on, fast-paced, and surprisingly creative.

By 2006, I was **Director of R\&D for Mobile Communications**, responsible for an international team of over 70 engineers across **France, China, and the Philippines**. We were delivering millions of smart cards, beating industry giants to global certifications, and even running basic web servers on SIM hardware.

Looking back, that period wasnâ€™t just about technical milestonesâ€”it was about learning how to scale, how to lead, and how to adapt to every new challenge thrown our way.

## Starting Out: Custom SIMs, Cryptography, and Learning the Business (2002â€“2003)

In those first two years, we delivered dozens of **custom SIM applications** to major European operators like **SFR**, **Orange**, **TIM**, **TelefÃ³nica**, and **Vodafone UK**. Each had their own feature requirements, security constraints, and legacy systems. Sometimes we had weeksâ€”sometimes daysâ€”to turn things around.

One of our flagship deliveries was a **feature-rich 2G SIM** for Vodafone UK. It included **RSA cryptography**, proprietary file systems, and multiple **JavaCard applets**, all packed into a few kilobytes. We worked in **embedded C and JavaCard**, targeting 16- and 32-bit chipsets (Infineon, STMicro, Atmel, Samsung). At the time, fitting all that functionality into a constrained environment felt like alchemy.

We were constantly juggling business pressureâ€”**critical fixes, urgent features**, customer demosâ€”with technical constraints. I learned quickly that delivering under pressure isnâ€™t just about working faster; itâ€™s about making thoughtful trade-offs, managing expectations, and communicating clearly.

To help manage that complexity, I introduced **ISO 9001:1994** methodologies into our team. We later transitioned to **ISO 9001:2000**, which helped us become more process-driven and audit-ready, without slowing us down. These frameworks kept quality highâ€”even as deadlines tightened.

## Becoming a Director: Growth, Quality, and Global Teams (2003â€“2006)

In late 2003, I was promoted to **Director of R\&D Mobile Communications**. My scope expanded dramatically: I now oversaw **all telecom product development** across sites in **France, China, and the Philippines**.

It was a period of **rapid growth**. Oberthurâ€™s card delivery volumes were growing **60% year-over-year**, and our team needed to keep pace. I reorganized our structure into agile product teams, strengthened our QA pipeline, and introduced roles to support specializationâ€”technical leads, release coordinators, and customer-facing engineers.

I also gained a new appreciation for **manufacturing and personalization constraints**. As our cards moved from prototypes to mass production, I worked more closely with our factories to understand their needs. What worked in a lab didnâ€™t always work at scale. I learned how to anticipate personalization bottlenecks, deal with chip shortages, and support last-minute customer configuration changesâ€”even when thousands of units were already on the line.

And beyond engineering, I started spending more time in **pre-sales**, meeting directly with mobile operators to support bids, clarify requirements, or solve technical roadblocks on-site. These momentsâ€”face-to-face, solving real problemsâ€”were some of the most satisfying.

## Pushing the Limits: WIB 1.3 and USIM Successes

In 2003, we delivered the **first SmartTrust-certified implementation of WIB 1.3**, a SIM-based WAP browser. Getting this tiny browser to run on limited hardware was a technical feat. Certification meant our product met every compliance specâ€”an essential requirement for mobile operators rolling out SIM-based services at scale.

Then came 3G. In 2004 and 2005, my team delivered **Oberthurâ€™s first USIM smart cards** certified by **Vodafone Group** and **Cingular Wireless**â€”beating out industry leaders like **Gemplus** and **Axalto**. These USIMs supported **3G authentication protocols**, enhanced file systems, and operator-specific extensions.

We immersed ourselves in **3GPP specifications**, debugged APDUs across dozens of handset models, and built rock-solid products that won operator trust. It was a technical and strategic win for Oberthurâ€”and a proud moment for my team.

## Innovation at the Edge (2005â€“2006)

Toward the end of my time at Oberthur, we explored what SIM cards could really do.

We worked with **Samsungâ€™s first flash-based 32-bit smartcard chip**, gaining performance and flexibility that previous EEPROM-based platforms couldnâ€™t match. That extra headroom inspired us to experiment.

* We built a **fully functional TCP/IP stack** that ran natively on the card.
* Then we went further and implemented a **basic HTTP web server**â€”on a smart card.

Was it production-grade? No. But it workedâ€”and it showed what was possible. It was one of those passion projects that reminded me why I loved R\&D.

## Asia and Learning to See the Bigger Picture

As our team and product lines expanded, I found myself traveling often to **China**, **Singapore**, **Thailand**, **Indonesia**, and the **Philippines**. I visited our local teams, toured factories, helped solve urgent issues, and learned more than I expectedâ€”about culture, collaboration, and humility.

In **Singapore**, I conducted **technical due diligence** on **Iâ€™M Technologies**, which Oberthur later acquired. In the **Philippines**, I spent time with our software team, helping align processes and roadmap priorities. Every trip taught me something newâ€”not just about engineering, but about people and perspective.

It was my first real exposure to Asia, and it left a lasting impression. I came back with a wider lens on the worldâ€”and a deep appreciation for what distributed teams can achieve when aligned by purpose.

## What I Took Away

By 2006, we had built an international R\&D organization delivering cutting-edge smart card products at scale. Weâ€™d passed every audit, beat top competitors to critical certifications, and delivered on high-stakes customer projects under pressure.

But the biggest lessons I took with me werenâ€™t technical. They were human.

* That **engineering under pressure** is about communication and judgment as much as code.
* That **quality processes**, when done right, free you to move fast.
* That **diverse teams across continents**, when trusted and empowered, will outperform expectations.
* And that leadership is more about creating space for others to thrive than it is about having all the answers.

Iâ€™m proud of the work we did. And Iâ€™m even more grateful for the people I did it with.
